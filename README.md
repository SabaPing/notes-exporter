This tool facilitates the export of Apple Notes into various formats including HTML (.html) attachment-embedded, Plain Text, Markdown, PDF, and Word (DOCX) with images / attachments and most formatting left intact.

You can use it either as a basic backup, or as a conversion tool - e.g. the Markdown format could be used in a note-taking tool like Obsidian which uses Markdown as standard.

This tool works on a Mac (OSX) not on a Windows or Linux machine because it uses AppleScript to extract the data from notes. You need to have the Notes app installed.

This allows for you to keep a local copy of your apple notes in case of failure, and also to use them in other markdown note-taking apps such as Obsidian, and quickly grab copies if you wish to send PDF versions to anyone, or work on a copy of the document from a Word document with all the images intact and inline in the right place.

It also extracts images from the notes, so they can also be referenced from local HTML (.htm) documents, Markdown, PDF, or Word (DOCX) documents.

## Setup

### Install homebrew

If Homebrew is not installed, open the Terminal and run this command:

```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Install Git

If Git is not already installed on your Mac, you can install it using Homebrew (or get a more up-to-date version!)

```bash
brew install git
```

### Decide where to download the script

Change directory in terminal to wherever you want the scripts to be downloaded to - e.g.

```bash
cd $HOME/Downloads
```

### Clone the Repository

Clone the `notes-exporter` repository from GitHub:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin/notes-exporter
cd ~/bin/notes-exporter
git clone https://github.com/storizzi/notes-exporter.git .
cd notes-exporter
```

### Install Python and Dependencies

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your Mac. Python 3 can be installed via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python
```

or alternatively if you want to use conda to install python environments you can use:
```bash
brew install --cask miniconda
```

If you are using conda, then you can get the script to do the next bit for you (see later) in which case you can skip the 'pip install' here - this is only recommended if you are installing python libraries globally.

After installing Python, install the required Python libraries using pip (markdownify is not required if you do not wish to generate markdown files and pypandoc is not required if you do not wish to generate docx / word files):

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4  # For parsing HTML files.
pip install markdownify     # For converting HTML to Markdown.
pip install pypandoc        # For converting HTML to DOCX. Requires Pandoc.
```
or alternatively ```pip install -r ./requirements.txt```

**Note:** `pypandoc` requires Pandoc for generating docx (word documents). If you need this functionality, install it using Homebrew if not already installed:

```bash
brew install pandoc
```

**Note:** To convert to PDF, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) needs to be installed

### Additional Dependencies

- **Google Chrome:** Needed for converting notes to PDF format.
- **Pandoc:** Required if converting notes to Word (DOCX) format.

## Basic Usage

The `exportnotes.zsh` script is used to export Apple Notes. It accepts various command-line parameters to customize the export process.

### Default Behavior

By default, the script will:

- Export notes for each account and folder in each account to the `~/Downloads/AppleNotesExport` directory as text in the `text` folder and as html files in the `html` folder - i.e. the AppleNotesExport folder inside the current user's Downloads folder, then the text / html folders underneath this, then a folder of the format `<account>-<folder/notebook>`
  - The filenames are a simplified version of the title of each note with a .html ending - these have the images embedded inside them
- Extract images from notes into the attachments folder
  - The filenames are the filename of the image in which the attachment appears followed by a dash, followed by a number - e.g. the document my-document.html will appear as attachments/my-document-001.png
- Not convert notes to Markdown, PDF, or Word unless specified.
- Effectively, this makes the script work like a 'backup' to html files which can be browsed with a web browser

### Running the Script

Ensure the script has execution permissions:

```bash
cd ~/bin/notes-exporter
chmod +x exportnotes.zsh
```

Run the script from the directory where it is located or add the script's directory to your `PATH` in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file for easy access. For example, if you place the scripts in `$HOME/bin/notes-exporter`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin/notes-exporter:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then, you can run the script from anywhere by just typing `exportnotes.zsh`.

### Examples

Export notes with default settings (backup to user's Documents/NotesExport directory):

```bash
exportnotes.zsh
```

Export notes with default settings in a python conda environment called `notesexport` auto-creating and activating the environment if it doesn't exist, and auto-installing the required pip dependencies - or just activating that environment if it already exists:

```bash
exportnotes.zsh --conda-env notesexport
```

Export notes to a specific directory and convert them to Markdown:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/Documents/NotesExport
exportnotes.zsh --root-dir $HOME/Documents/NotesExport --convert-markdown true
```

Use existing imported files from a specific directory and convert to PDF

```bash
mkdir $HOME/Documents/NotesExport
exportnotes.zsh --root-dir $HOME/Documents/NotesExport --extract-data false --convert-pdf true
```

Suppress headers and footers in PDF and also convert to Word:

```bash
exportnotes.zsh -s true -w true
```

Convert notes in a specific directory to Markdown without getting any apple notes, creating a conda environment at the start, and cleaning up that environment afterwards

```bash
exportnotes.zsh --root-dir $HOME/AppleNotesExport --conda-env exportnotes --extract-data false --convert-markdown true --remove-conda-env true
```

Import notes using filenames starting Note- then with the title, then another - and the internal ID of the note at the end

```bash
exportnotes.zsh  --filename-format "Note-&title-&id"
```

Import notes using filenames using the account name and the internal apple note ID and the folder ID without having subdirectories for the folder name

```bash
exportnotes.zsh --filename-format "&account-&folder-&id" --use-subdirs false
```

### Environment Variables

Instead of using command line parameters, you can set up environment variables which will be used by default (and which can be overridden by command line parameters) if for example you want to set up a standard way of working when running the script but sometimes override the behavior.

The available environment variables are:

- `NOTES_EXPORT_ROOT_DIR`: Specifies the root directory where the exported notes will be stored. Default is `$HOME/Downloads/AppleNotesExport`.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_SUPPRESS_CHROME_HEADER_PDF`: Controls whether headers and footers are suppressed in PDF exports. Set to `true` to suppress, `false` otherwise.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_CONVERT_TO_MARKDOWN`: Enables the conversion of notes to Markdown format. Set to `true` to enable conversion, `false` otherwise.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_CONVERT_TO_PDF`: Enables the conversion of notes to PDF format. Set to `true` to enable conversion, `false` otherwise.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_CONVERT_TO_WORD`: Enables the conversion of notes to Word (DOCX) format. Set to `true` to enable conversion, `false` otherwise.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_EXTRACT_IMAGES`: Controls the extraction of images from notes. Set to `true` to extract images, `false` otherwise.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_EXTRACT_DATA`: Determines whether to extract data from Apple Notes using the AppleScript to text and raw html files. Set to `true` to extract, `false` otherwise.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_NOTE_LIMIT`: Sets a limit on the total number of notes to export. Default is no limit.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_NOTE_LIMIT_PER_FOLDER`: Sets a limit on the number of notes to export per folder. Default is no limit.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_NOTE_PICK_PROBABILITY`: Sets the probability (as a percentage) of picking a note for export. Default is 100%.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_FILENAME_FORMAT`: Format of main part of filename before the filetype for word/pdf/html. Default is `&title` but can contain `&title` for a sanitized version of the title (note this can change), `&id` for the internal id Apple uses for the note, `&account` for the account name, `&folder` for the folder name, `&accountid` for the internal account id, and `&shortaccountid` for the short account id. You can include other characters, e.g. `Note-&title-&id` to make each note prefixed with `Note-` followed by the sanitized title, followed by a dash, followed by the note ID (just in case of duplicated titles).
- `NOTES_EXPORT_SUBDIR_FORMAT`: Format of subdirectory for each account and folder combination. Default is `&account-&folder` but can contain `&account` for the account name, `&folder` for the folder name, `&accountid` for the internal account id, and `&shortaccountid` for the short account id.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_USE_SUBDIRS`: Set to `false` to keep all files in a single directory (flattened). Default is `true`.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_CONDA_ENV`: Specifies the Conda environment to use. If the environment does not exist, it will be created and the required dependencies installed. Defaults to nothing being created.
- `NOTES_EXPORT_REMOVE_CONDA_ENV`: Remove the specified Conda environment after the script runs. Set to `true` to remove, `false` otherwise. Default is `false`.

You could add these to your `.zshrc` file for example to set up defaults so you don't have to use command-line parameters if you want to set up a specific location to export to, for example - e.g.

```text
export NOTES_EXPORT_ROOT_DIR=$HOME/Documents/NotesExport
```

### Configure Zsh

To make the scripts easily accessible, add the script directory to your `PATH` in the `.zshrc` file so you can just run the command when you open the terminal:

1. **Open `.zshrc` in a text editor (e.g., nano, vim):**

   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```
2. **Add the following line to the file:**
   Replace `/path/to/notes-exporter` with the actual path to the `notes-exporter` directory - e.g. `$HOME/bin` if you have copied the files to the `bin` directory for your user's mac account.

   ```text
   export PATH="/path/to/notes-exporter:$PATH"
   ```
3. **Save and close the file:**
   If using nano, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y` to save, and `Enter` to exit.
4. **Reload the `.zshrc` file:**

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
   or just start a new Terminal window or tab.

## Scheduling Automatic Exports

You can schedule the notes export to run automatically at regular intervals using macOS's built-in `launchd` system. This is more reliable than using `cron` for AppleScript-based tasks because it runs with full user permissions and GUI access.

## Setup Automatic Scheduling

#### Permissions Setup

**Important**: The first time you run the script (either manually or scheduled), macOS will prompt for permissions to access the Notes app. To avoid repeated popups:

1. **Grant Full Disk Access** to Terminal (or your shell):
   - System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Full Disk Access
   - Click the lock and enter your password
   - Click "+" and add Terminal (or iTerm if you use that)

2. **Grant Accessibility permissions** to osascript:
   - System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility  
   - Add Terminal and/or osascript if prompted

3. **Allow automation** for the Notes app:
   - When first prompted, click "OK" to allow Terminal to control Notes
   - Or go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Automation
   - Ensure Terminal is allowed to control Notes

Once these permissions are granted, the scheduled jobs will run without prompts.

### Install the Scheduling Tool

A Python script is provided to easily set up and manage scheduled exports. This script handles all the complexity of creating the necessary configuration files and setting correct permissions.

First, ensure you have Python 3 installed (it should be available if you followed the setup instructions above).

#### Create Scheduled Export

To set up a daily export at 9:00 AM:

```bash
cd ~/bin/notes-exporter
python3 setup_launchd.py
```

Or with custom scheduling options:

```bash
# Run daily at 2:30 PM
python3 setup_launchd.py --hour 14 --minute 30

# Run every 60 minutes
python3 setup_launchd.py --interval 60

# Different script directory
python3 setup_launchd.py --script-dir /path/to/notes-exporter
```

This creates:
- A wrapper script that properly loads your shell environment
- A launchd configuration file for scheduling
- A logs directory for monitoring the exports
- A sample `.env` file for custom environment variables

#### Manage the Scheduled Job

After creating the setup, use these commands to manage your scheduled exports:

```bash
# Start scheduling (activate the job)
python3 setup_launchd.py --load

# Test run manually to verify it works
python3 setup_launchd.py --test

# Check if the job is currently scheduled
python3 setup_launchd.py --status

# Stop scheduling (but keep files)
python3 setup_launchd.py --unload

# Remove everything (stop scheduling and delete all setup files)
python3 setup_launchd.py --remove
```

#### Environment Variables for Scheduled Jobs

When running as a scheduled job, you may want to set custom environment variables. Edit the `.env` file in your script directory:

```bash
nano .env
```

Example `.env` configuration:

```bash
# Export settings
export NOTES_EXPORT_ROOT_DIR="$HOME/Documents/NotesBackup"
export NOTES_EXPORT_CONVERT_TO_MARKDOWN="true"
export NOTES_EXPORT_EXTRACT_IMAGES="true"

# Conda environment
export NOTES_EXPORT_CONDA_ENV="notes-export"

# Custom PATH additions (if needed)
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Monitor Scheduled Exports

View the logs to see if your scheduled exports are working:

```bash
# View recent output
tail -f logs/stdout.log

# View any errors
tail -f logs/stderr.log

# View debug information
tail -f logs/debug.log
```

The debug log shows environment information that can help troubleshoot any issues with the scheduled execution.

#### Typical Workflow

1. **Set up**: `python3 setup_launchd.py --hour 9`
2. **Configure**: Edit `.env` file if needed for custom settings
3. **Activate**: `python3 setup_launchd.py --load`
4. **Test**: `python3 setup_launchd.py --test`
5. **Monitor**: Check logs periodically

#### Troubleshooting Scheduled Jobs

If your scheduled job isn't working:

1. **Check job status**: `python3 setup_launchd.py --status`
2. **Review logs**: Look at `logs/stderr.log` for errors
3. **Test manually**: Run `python3 setup_launchd.py --test`
4. **Check permissions**: The script automatically sets correct permissions, but verify your Notes app has necessary accessibility permissions
5. **Environment issues**: Check `logs/debug.log` for environment variable problems

**Note**: Scheduled jobs run in a more limited environment than your normal terminal session. The wrapper script sources your shell configuration files and the `.env` file to ensure the necessary environment is available.

#### Remove Scheduling

To completely remove the scheduled export setup:

```bash
python3 setup_launchd.py --remove
```

This unloads the job and removes the scheduling files while leaving your main `exportnotes.zsh` script and any exported data intact.
